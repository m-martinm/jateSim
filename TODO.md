# TODO

- refactor the Gate class to be able to add a proper NOT-gate
- add Option to save and load files
- - probably should "implement Serializable"
    - maybe add a static ArrayList to Engine and save everything which is displayed there and then serialize it
- implement "BlackBox"
    - puts the selected components to a blackbox and displays it as a box
